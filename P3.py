#Problem 3: Unique Characters in a String
#DES:Create a function that determines whether all characters in a given string are unique.
#  If the string has all unique characters, return True; otherwise, return False.

##Thinking####
# if the string is unique, but hello doesn't work, this could mean characters cannot be repeated.

def unique_char():
    pass
